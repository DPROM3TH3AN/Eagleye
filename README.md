# Tracking System

This is an AI-powered, full-stack tracking system that integrates:

- **Chatbot**: Uses NLP (NLTK and regex) for message processing with secured and open endpoints.
- **Device Tracking**: Simulates GPS/IMEI tracking, enriched with TomTom AI for advanced location intelligence, realtime updates through WebSockets, and interactive map generation with Folium.
- **Phone Analysis**: Utilizes the `phonenumbers` library and OpenCage API for phone validation and geolocation.
- **Data Storage**: Stores tracking data in Supabase.
- **Frontend**: A simple HTML/CSS/JS interface for interacting with the API.
